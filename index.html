<p>The font I have used for my brand is Century Gothic. I decided to use it because it is the font I used for my wordmark but it is also a very attractive font for a website. </p>

    <h1>Colour Palette</h1>
        <img class="palette" src="images/colourpalette.jpg" alt="Colour Palette">
    <p>Above is the combination of colour I have choose for my brand colour palette. I wanted to keep my brand based around the colour blue for consistency. The colour blue stands for alot of things including trust, loyalty, faith, and wisdom all that I would like to portraty through my brand and with my customers. I have choosen a mixture of darker blues and lighter blues which together create an exciting palette. I have also choosen a light grey colour which is very complimentary with the shades of blue I have choosen.  </p>

    <h1>Visual Marque</h1>
    <p> My visual marque is the face of my brand and will always be present alongside the wordmark I have created. After a long period of trying to work out what I could choose as a marque which would represent me as a person and for my brand so I choose the bull. The bull Taurus is my star sign due to being born in may and is something that my granda always held close to him as he wears a tauras necklace around his neck and always tells me that one day it will be mine so I thought it would be perfect as a visual marque. Taurus represents creativity, attraction, practicality, responsibility and people with the star sign  are said to be great in making money and they stick to their projects and goals until successfully completed. So hopefully as an identity it can be very helpful!</p> 
        <p>I wanted to integrate something that communicated me as a designers so I decided to go with the pencil and pen which intersects the bull down the middle. Im happy with how this turned out as I feel it works well and the pen can be seen as the nose. All the colours that make up the bull are from my colour palette. I choose a blue bull because of my blue eyes and the connection it would have.</p>

    <h1>Monogram</h1>
    <p> My monogram was the first thing I was tasked with creating for my visual identity. I studied many ways I could use the letters R and M as a combination, looking at different styles, shapes and angles of the the letters and how they could work together to create a unique monogram. At the start I could never have imagined this as my finished design but after lots of sketching and experimenting with the two letter forms I could see what direction I was going in. I seen how I could adjust the M to form parallels with the legs of the R and then use them together to create this as my final design.   </p>
        <p>For my wordmark I used the font Century Gothic. I edited the kerning inbetween each letter until it felt right with the monogram.  The letter As I edited so that they fitted with the angle in my wordmark.

<h1>Brand Guidelines</h1>

<p>These guidelines outline how my brand can be adopted and how
my identity system should be applied.</p>

<p>My personal identity system which includes my monogram, wordmark and visual marque has been
designed to be a practical and cost-effective
solution for consistent identity creation.
Its made to work across different media platforms and to be used differently in different situations.</p>
            
<p> I have two differnet identities, my monogram and my visual marque both which are used alongside my wordmark. I have created principles of how the two lock-ups work and the identity exclusion zone. Both are illustrated below. They have been designed
to keep the sizing, weight and spacing of the
two elements consistent. </p>
            
<p>Figure A shows the lock up and identity exclusion zone of the wordmark.</p>
<p>Figure B shows the lock up and the identity exclusion zone of the visual marque.</p>
<p>A.</p>

<p>B.</p>
<img class="lockup" src="images/visualmarquelockup.jpg" alt="Visual Marque Lockup" />

<p>This spacing of 60px is the standard for all logos and icons. No lettering or images should come within the 60px identity exclusion zone.</p>
    <h3>Avoid doing any of the following.</h3>
        
<ul>
    <li>Change the colour of the visual marque. </li>
        <li>Rotate the visual marque.  </li>
        <li>Stretch or try to resize. </li>
        <li>Change the colour of the marque. </li>
        <li>Use the marque without the wordmark. </li>
        </ul>
